      <p>Vaccinations protect you from infection of specific diseases that can make you sick or disable you or in some extreme cases cause death. They boost your body’s immune system through the introduction of a substance used to stimulate the production of antibodies and provide immunity against one or several diseases.
        <br>At Ellerbe Pharmacy, you can receive all of your necessary vaccines, which include but are not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Hepatitis A</li>
    <li>Hepatitis B</li>
    <li>HPV</li>
    <li>Typhoid</li>
    <li>Tetanus</li>
    <li>Diphtheria</li>
    <li>Pertussis</li>
    <li>Meningococcal</li>
    <li>Pneumococcal</li>
    <li>COVID-19 (MODERNA & PFIZER) available now.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Vaccine Safety</h3>
    <p>
    Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part, these are minor (for example, a sore arm or low-grade fever) and will go away within a few days. Our trained pharmacists will go over any possible side effects of the vaccine with you.

    Please call any time to make an appointment for your vaccines. As with all of our services at Ellerbe Pharmacy, we are committed to providing you with the highest quality of patient care.
    <h3>Are you protected against Shingles?</h3>
    <p>
  Shingles is a painful skin rash experienced by almost a million people each year. The primary symptom is severe pain and is often accompanied by fever, headache, chills and upset stomach that last from two to four weeks. Caused by the varicella zoster virus, ‘shingles’ comes from the same virus strain that causes chickenpox. Often after an individual experiences chickenpox, the virus will remain dormant in the body and reactivate years later causing shingles.

  Approximately one out of every three people in the United States will develop shingles. The risk of contracting shingles increases with age; nearly half of all cases occur in individuals age 50 years and older. Individuals who experience shingles will likely only develop it once in their lifetime, though in rare instances, it may be contracted more than once.

  The best protection against shingles is vaccination. The CDC reports “In a clinical trial involving thousands of adults 50 years old or older, Zostavax reduced the risk of shingles by 51%.” Zostavax is the most reliable prevention of this painful disease and is available at your Ellerbe PHARMACY without a prescription. Zostavax is covered by most insurance and we offer the best price in town for uninsured patients.
